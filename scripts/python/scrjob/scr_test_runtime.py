class SCR_Test_Runtime:
    """SCR_Test_Runtime class contains methods to determine whether we should launch with SCR

  This class contains methods to test the environment, to ensure SCR will be able to function.
  These tests are called in scr_prerun.py, immediately after checking if scr is enabled.
  Not all methods are appropriate to test in every environment.
  Additional test methods may be added to this class to integrate into the pre-run tests.
  Test methods should run without arguments and return an integer representing PASS / FAIL.

  We could receive a list of applicable tests through:
    A configuration file.
    A compile constant (scr_const.py).
    Environment variables.
    Querying the ResourceManager and/or Joblauncher classes.

  Currently the ResourceManager is queried, which aligns with the original bash/perl scripts.

  Each test in the list, that is a callable method in this class, will be called during scr_prerun.
  If any indicated test fails then scr_prerun will fail.

  This class is currently a 'static' class, not intended to be instantiated.
  The __new__ method is used to launch the tests, this method returns the success value.
  Methods other than `__new__` should be decorated with `@staticmethod`.

  Test Return Values
  ------------------
  Each test should return an integer:
  0 - PASS
  1 - FAIL
