# This script attempts to get the job step id for the last srun command that 
# was launched. The argument to this script is the PID of the srun command.
# The script first calls squeue to get the job steps for this job.
# It assumes that the highest numbered job step is the right one (meaning the
# last one that was started).
# Then it checks to see if the srun command with PID is still running. The idea
# here is that if the srun command died, then the job step with the highest number
# is for some other srun command and not the one we are looking for. 
# This script returns the job step id on success and -1 on failure.
