/* There are three directories where SCR manages files: control, cache, and prefix.
 *
 * The control directory is a fixed location where a job records its state and reads files
 * to interpret commands from the user.  This directory is fixed (hard coded) so that
 * scr utility scripts know where to look to read and write these files.
 *
 * The cache directory is where the job will cache its checkpoint files.
 * This can be changed by the user (via SCR_CACHE_BASE) to target
 * different devices (e.g. RAM disc vs. SSD). By default, it uses the same prefix as the
 * control directory.
 *
 * The prefix directory is where the job will create checkpoint directories and flush
 * checkpoint files to.  Typically, this is on a parallel file system and is set via SCR_PREFIX.
 * If SCR_PREFIX is not set, the current working directory of the running program is used.
